function Patches                 = ReadPatches(filenames);
% ReadPatches reads triangulated patch files into a common structure.
%    Patches = ReadPatches(FILENAMES) reads in triangulated patch files
%    specified by the space-delimited string of FILENAMES and returns 
%    their geometry to the structure Patches.
%
%    FILENAMES is a space-separated string containing filenames, with 
%    full paths if not in the current directory, of element files to 
%    be read. Acceptable file formats are .msh (from Gmsh), .mat (from
%    Matlab), and .ts (from GOCAD). Files can be of mixed type, as long
%    as the extension is specified. 
% 
%    The returned structure Patches contains fields:
%          c    : all vertex coordinates (n x 3)
%          v    : element vertex indices (m x 3)
%          nEl  : number of elements in each patch file
%          nc   : number of coordinates in each patch file
%
%    The meshes can be visualized using meshview(Patches.c, Patches.v). 
%
